# EMC_project

I created this project in Matlab 2016 back in college, for a discipline called Electromagnetic compatibility. 
The requirements for the project were:
- graphical user interface;
- the possibility to set the parameters for the carrier and modulator signals;
- the option to add a noise over the modulated signal;
- the option to plot the modulated signal in time and frequency domain;
- the option to extract through demodulation the informational signal and show it in time and frequency domain.

The modulator signal can be either a sine wave, a square wave, a sawtooth wave or a sum of sine waves. You can choose which type of modulator signal you want from the user interface. 

The user interface parameters are in Romanian, but you can contact me if you need any help with the translation and application use.
